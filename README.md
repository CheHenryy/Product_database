# Customer sales Analysis 
The prepository contains analysis of product and sales data from a AdventureWorks2025 database using sql and python. 
## Folders
This repository consist of two folders: Data and Scripts.
The data folder consists of SQL statements used to extract data for each visualisation.
The scripts folder consist of the report file that hold the python code, figures and a brief description of the figures. 

### Structure 
The report notebooks begins with importing the necessary libraries and connecting to the SQL server. Following this is a function that takes the SQL statments and produces a
dataframe that will be used in making different visualisations using searborn. 

For each visualisation, I begin with the main goal, followed by the specific question i wish to answer, the tables used and lastly the a brief description of the resulting figure.
